			<h1>Welcome to my Coolmath Games Hacks</h1>
			<p>This is my project that aims to make paid features on Coolmath Games free!</p>
			<p>Features include a full screen button, enabling games while you have your adblocker on and more coming soon!</p>
			<h2>Instructions:</h2>

			<h2>About:</h2>
			<p>Hi. My name is Joel and I created this script so I could play cool math games in class while the firewall was blocking ads and Coolmath Games was refusing to load games. I will keep working on this and improving it and may turn it into a chrome extension some day so you don't need to click the bookmark every time.</p>
